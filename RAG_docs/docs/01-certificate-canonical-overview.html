<h2 id="canonical-overview-conceptual-framework-rag-anchor">Canonical Overview &amp; Conceptual Framework (RAG Anchor)</h2>

<h3 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h3>

<p>The Generative AI Fluency Certificate is a practical, skills-based program designed to equip lifelong learners with foundational knowledge and strategic capabilities required to responsibly and effectively use generative AI tools in academic, creative, and workplace contexts. Rather than focusing on specific tools or isolated techniques, the certificate emphasizes durable understanding, sound judgment, and intentional design—skills that remain relevant as technologies evolve.</p>

<p>The certificate is organized around a four-module learning arc that reflects an increasingly sophisticated relationship with generative AI. Participants begin by building accurate mental models of how generative AI systems function and where they fail. They then learn how to collaborate with AI systems in ways that expand thinking without outsourcing judgment. From there, the program shifts toward practical reality: designing AI interactions that are consistent, reusable, and accountable in real work contexts. The final module extends these principles beyond text to multimodal systems, addressing opportunities and risks in image, audio, and video generation.</p>

<p>Throughout the program, emphasis is placed on human agency, ethical responsibility, and transparency. Participants are encouraged to view AI not as an authority or decision-maker, but as a probabilistic system whose value depends on how it is framed, constrained, and documented. Particular attention is given to responsibilities introduced when AI-assisted processes are reused or shared, including disclosure, privacy, and error propagation.</p>

<h3 id="program-purpose">Program Purpose</h3>

<p>Help participants move from surface-level experimentation with generative AI to intentional, responsible, discipline-aware use across teaching, learning, research, creative practice, and workplace contexts.</p>

<h3 id="guiding-principles">Guiding Principles</h3>

<ul>
<li>Generative AI systems are probabilistic, not authoritative.</li>
<li>Human judgment remains central at every stage of AI-assisted work.</li>
<li>AI is most valuable when it expands thinking, not when it replaces it.</li>
<li>Reuse and sharing introduce ethical and practical responsibility.</li>
<li>Documentation and transparency support accountability and trust.</li>
<li>Tools will change; principles and practices should endure.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-learning-arc">The Learning Arc</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Understanding</strong> — Accurate mental models of how GenAI works and fails  </li>
<li><strong>Collaborating</strong> — Iterative inquiry that expands thinking without outsourcing judgment  </li>
<li><strong>Designing</strong> — Consistent, reusable AI interactions that hold up under reuse and scrutiny  </li>
<li><strong>Expanding</strong> — Applying the same critical framework to multimodal systems</li>
</ol>

<p>Modules are intentionally sequenced and are not designed to be interchangeable.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="module-1-what-genai-is-and-what-it-isnt">Module 1: What GenAI Is — and What It Isn’t</h2>

<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>

<p>Establish foundational mental models for how generative AI works and where it falls short. Participants examine the mechanisms that drive generative models, recognize constraints, and develop realistic expectations.</p>

<h3 id="learning-emphasis">Learning Emphasis</h3>

<ul>
<li>Demystifying generative AI</li>
<li>Distinguishing capability from appearance</li>
<li>Recognizing constraints and risks (hallucinations, bias, context limits)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="boundary">Boundary</h3>

<p>This module does not focus on effective <em>use</em>; it focuses on accurate understanding.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="module-2-collaborative-iteration-with-genai">Module 2: Collaborative Iteration with GenAI</h2>

<h3 id="purpose-2">Purpose</h3>

<p>Shift from passively receiving outputs to actively engaging AI as a collaborator in inquiry and idea development. The emphasis is on shaping conversations to support human thinking rather than delegating decisions.</p>

<h3 id="learning-emphasis-2">Learning Emphasis</h3>

<ul>
<li>Inquiry over output</li>
<li>Expansion of cognitive bandwidth</li>
<li>Retaining human judgment and authority</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="includes-by-design">Includes (by design)</h3>

<p><strong>Lightweight, conversational personalization</strong> (tone, perspective, questioning style) to improve collaboration <em>within a session</em>.</p>

<h3 id="boundary-2">Boundary</h3>

<p>Personalization here is ephemeral and conversation-specific. This module does not create reusable workflows, templates, or persistent system behavior.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="module-3-designing-consistent-ai-interactions">Module 3: Designing Consistent AI Interactions</h2>

<h3 id="purpose-3">Purpose</h3>

<p>Move from exploratory use to intentionally designed interactions that support consistency, reuse, and accountability. Participants learn to shape AI behavior proactively rather than fixing outputs after the fact, with attention to downstream impact.</p>

<h3 id="learning-emphasis-3">Learning Emphasis</h3>

<ul>
<li>Interaction design over prompt cleverness</li>
<li>Reliability and reproducibility rather than “better answers”</li>
<li>Responsibility introduced by reuse and sharing</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="key-topics">Key Topics</h3>

<ul>
<li>What “consistency” means in probabilistic systems</li>
<li>Prompt patterns and reusable templates</li>
<li>Grounding AI with participant materials (documents, examples, curated references)</li>
<li>Selecting appropriate levels of structure (prompt → template → agent/workflow)</li>
<li>Documentation practices that support reuse and auditability</li>
<li>Ethical risks introduced by persistence, reuse, and context collapse</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="boundary-3">Boundary</h3>

<p>This module is about designed interactions others (or future-you) may rely on—not momentary personalization.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="module-4-engaging-with-multimodal-genai">Module 4: Engaging with Multimodal GenAI</h2>

<h3 id="purpose-4">Purpose</h3>

<p>Expand beyond text to image, audio, and video generation/analysis. Participants apply the same critical frameworks while developing literacy for new affordances and risks introduced by multimodal systems.</p>

<h3 id="learning-emphasis-4">Learning Emphasis</h3>

<ul>
<li>Transfer of principles across modalities</li>
<li>Critical evaluation of synthetic media</li>
<li>Accessibility, ethics, and media literacy</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="boundary-4">Boundary</h3>

<p>This module does not assume multimodal outputs are inherently better; it focuses on appropriate, critical, and ethical use.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="program-elements-completion-structure">Program Elements (Completion &amp; Structure)</h2>

<h3 id="electives">Electives</h3>

<p>Participants complete <strong>two AI-related electives</strong> (events, workshops, or trainings) aligned with professional goals. Electives deepen learning but do not replace the core arc.</p>

<p><strong>Elective criteria (recommended):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Active engagement with AI concepts/tools/ethics (not passive exposure)</li>
<li>Clear connection to at least one core module</li>
<li>Evidence of completion (documentation or reflection)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="learning-reflection-project-learning-journal-portfolio">Learning Reflection Project (Learning Journal / Portfolio)</h3>

<p>Participants maintain a learning journal that captures developing fluency with generative AI. Each module contributes artifacts (prompt examples, AI-assisted drafts, reflections, multimodal creations) documenting growth in skill and awareness.</p>

<p><strong>Time expectation:</strong> roughly <strong>6–10 hours</strong> across the certificate.<br />
Most effort should be hands-on practice; reflections can be intentionally brief and used as anchors.</p>

<h3 id="total-time">Total Time</h3>

<p>Designed for approximately <strong>15–20 total hours</strong> (guided instruction + experimentation + learning artifact creation).</p>
