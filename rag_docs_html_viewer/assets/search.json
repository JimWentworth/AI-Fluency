How to use (recommended workflow) Start with the Canonical Overview (01_...). Treat it as the source of truth for the learning arc and module boundaries. When making changes, record why in Design Rationale & Decisions (03_...). Keep it short, decision-focused. For any new page/activity, follow the Canvas + DesignPLUS Implementation Guide (06_...) and validate against the Example page (07_...). Use Tool Documentation References (05_...) whenever you need to verify platform capabilities. Use Branding & Accessibility Guardrails (04_...) when styling pages, selecting colors, and creating visuals. Design norm (internal) We document \u201cbehind-the-scenes\u201d work.

Rather than focusing on specific tools or isolated techniques, the certificate emphasizes durable understanding, sound judgment, and intentional design\u2014skills that remain relevant as technologies evolve. The certificate is organized around a four-module learning arc that reflects an increasingly sophisticated relationship with generative AI. Participants begin by building accurate mental models of how generative AI systems function and where they fail. They then learn how to collaborate with AI systems in ways that expand thinking without outsourcing judgment. From there, the program shifts toward practical reality: designing AI interactions that are consistent, reusable, and accountable in real work contexts. The final module extends these principles beyond text to multimodal systems, addressing opportunities and risks in image, audio, and video generation. Throughout the program, emphasis is placed on human agency, ethical responsibility, and transparency. Participants are encouraged to view AI not as an authority or decision-maker, but as a probabilistic system whose value depends on how it is framed, constrained, and documented. Particular attention is given to responsibilities introduced when AI-assisted processes are reused or shared, including disclosure, privacy, and error propagation. Program Purpose Help participants move from surface-level experimentation with generative AI to intentional, responsible, discipline-aware use across teaching, learning, research, creative practice, and workplace contexts. Guiding Principles Generative AI systems are probabilistic, not authoritative. Human judgment remains central at every stage of AI-assisted work. AI is most valuable when it expands thinking, not when it replaces it. Reuse and sharing introduce ethical and practical responsibility. Documentation and transparency support accountability and trust. Tools will change; principles and practices should endure. The Learning Arc Understanding \u2014 Accurate mental models of how GenAI works and fails Collaborating \u2014 Iterative inquiry that expands thinking without outsourcing judgment Designing \u2014 Consistent, reusable AI interactions that hold up under reuse and scrutiny Expanding \u2014 Applying the same critical framework to multimodal systems Modules are intentionally sequenced and are not designed to be interchangeable. Module 1: What GenAI Is \u2014 and What It Isn\u2019t Purpose Establish foundational mental models for how generative AI works and where it falls short. Participants examine the mechanisms that drive generative models, recognize constraints, and develop realistic expectations. Learning Emphasis Demystifying generative AI Distinguishing capability from appearance Recognizing constraints and risks (hallucinations, bias, context limits) Boundary This module does not focus on effective use ; it focuses on accurate understanding. Module 2: Collaborative Iteration with GenAI Purpose Shift from passively receiving outputs to actively engaging AI as a collaborator in inquiry and idea development. The emphasis is on shaping conversations to support human thinking rather than delegating decisions. Learning Emphasis Inquiry over output Expansion of cognitive bandwidth Retaining human judgment and authority Includes (by design) Lightweight, conversational personalization (tone, perspective, questioning style) to improve collaboration within a session . Boundary Personalization here is ephemeral and conversation-specific. This module does not create reusable workflows, templates, or persistent system behavior. Module 3: Designing Consistent AI Interactions Purpose Move from exploratory use to intentionally designed interactions that support consistency, reuse, and accountability. Participants learn to shape AI behavior proactively rather than fixing outputs after the fact, with attention to downstream impact. Learning Emphasis Interaction design over prompt cleverness Reliability and reproducibility rather than \u201cbetter answers\u201d Responsibility introduced by reuse and sharing Key Topics What \u201cconsistency\u201d means in probabilistic systems Prompt patterns and reusable templates Grounding AI with participant materials (documents, examples, curated references) Selecting appropriate levels of structure (prompt \u2192 template \u2192 agent/workflow) Documentation practices that support reuse and auditability Ethical risks introduced by persistence, reuse, and context collapse Boundary This module is about designed interactions others (or future-you) may rely on\u2014not momentary personalization. Module 4: Engaging with Multimodal GenAI Purpose Expand beyond text to image, audio, and video generation/analysis. Participants apply the same critical frameworks while developing literacy for new affordances and risks introduced by multimodal systems. Learning Emphasis Transfer of principles across modalities Critical evaluation of synthetic media Accessibility, ethics, and media literacy Boundary This module does not assume multimodal outputs are inherently better; it focuses on appropriate, critical, and ethical use. Program Elements (Completion & Structure) Electives Participants complete two AI-related electives (events, workshops, or trainings) aligned with professional goals. Electives deepen learning but do not replace the core arc. Elective criteria (recommended): Active engagement with AI concepts/tools/ethics (not passive exposure) Clear connection to at least one core module Evidence of completion (documentation or reflection) Learning Reflection Project (Learning Journal / Portfolio) Participants maintain a learning journal that captures developing fluency with generative AI. Each module contributes artifacts (prompt examples, AI-assisted drafts, reflections, multimodal creations) documenting growth in skill and awareness. Time expectation: roughly 6\u201310 hours across the certificate. Most effort should be hands-on practice; reflections can be intentionally brief and used as anchors. Total Time Designed for approximately 15\u201320 total hours (guided instruction + experimentation + learning artifact creation)."}, {"slug": "02-design-process-transparency-provenance", "title": "Design Process, Transparency, and Provenance", "filename": "02_Design_Process_Transparency_Provenance.md", "text": "Design Process, Transparency, and Provenance Internal working norms (institutional visibility) Why this exists The certificate is built using iterative design work that may include AI-assisted drafting. To keep the work defensible, reusable, and collaboratively maintainable, we treat process transparency as a core design norm. What \u201cbehind-the-scenes documentation\u201d means (internal) We preserve enough context for future collaborators (and future-us) to answer: What was the intent? What constraints were we designing under? What tradeoffs were considered? What decision did we make, and why? What should not be inferred (boundaries / non-goals)? This is not a demand for polished memos. Draft notes are acceptable. Legibility beats perfection. AI use in certificate creation (norms) AI may assist with: synthesis, drafting, reframing, checklists, template generation, and formatting support.\nAI should not: silently erase debate, remove uncertainty, or \u201coptimize\u201d away intentional boundaries.

Use UIUC primary colors purposefully and accessibly; avoid overusing secondary palettes. Prefer consistent typography and spacing rules across pages to reduce cognitive load. Clearly mark what is official certificate content vs. external vendor examples. Accessibility guardrails (non-negotiable) Ensure adequate color contrast for text and key UI elements. Provide alt text for images and meaningful labels for buttons/interactive elements. Avoid \u201ccolor-only\u201d meaning (use icons/labels in addition to color). Keep layouts responsive for mobile and varied screen sizes. AI-generated visuals and institutional representation AI-generated images/text used in official materials must be reviewed for: brand consistency accessibility clarity and appropriateness for the audience Avoid synthetic imagery that could imply official endorsements or misrepresent the university.
