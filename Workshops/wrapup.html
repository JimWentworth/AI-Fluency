    <h2>Module 2 Wrap-Up</h2>
    <p>
        This page is designed to consolidate your learning from Module 2: <strong>Iterative Collaboration with GenAI</strong>.
        Use it to check your understanding, reflect on how you want to work with AI going forward, and provide feedback
        on the module.
    </p>

    <div class="callout">
        <svg class="icon" width="22" height="22" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="#E84A27" aria-hidden="true">
            <path d="M12 2L2 7l10 5 10-5-10-5zm0 13.09L5 10.18v6.72L12 22l7-5.1v-6.72l-7 4.91z"/>
        </svg>
        <strong>Goal:</strong> Leave this module with a clear picture of where AI belongs in your own practice, and
        how you will use iterative collaboration intentionally rather than reactively.
    </div>

    <h2>Knowledge Check: Can You Apply the Core Ideas?</h2>
    <p>
        Use the questions below as a self-check. Expand each item to compare your thinking with suggested responses.
        These can be used in-class as discussion prompts or adapted into quizzes.
    </p>

    <details>
        <summary>1. Input/Output vs. Inquiry</summary>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> In one or two sentences, explain the difference between using AI as an input/output tool
        and using it as an inquiry partner.</p>
        <p><strong>Suggested answer:</strong></p>
        <pre>
Using AI as an input/output tool means asking for a single answer and accepting it at face value.
Using AI as an inquiry partner means engaging in a back-and-forth process to explore assumptions,
surface alternatives, and iteratively refine ideas while I remain responsible for judgment.
        </pre>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>2. When Should Human Expertise Lead?</summary>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Describe one example from your own context where AI can help, and one where
        AI should be strictly advisory or not used at all.</p>
        <p><strong>Suggested answer (structure):</strong></p>
        <pre>
Helpful use:
- Example where AI broadens options, drafts alternatives, or reframes ideas
- Task is exploratory or low-stakes

Human must lead:
- Example involving grading, ethics, personnel decisions, or sensitive student data
- Task is high-stakes, context-specific, or value-laden
        </pre>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>3. Iterative Prompting</summary>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Outline the basic steps in an iterative prompting loop you might use for a
        real task (e.g., designing an assignment, drafting communication, or planning a workshop).</p>
        <p><strong>Suggested answer:</strong></p>
        <pre>
1) Provide context and ask for an initial draft or set of ideas.
2) Diagnose what is useful, missing, or misaligned.
3) Ask for revision that narrows or deepens in a specific direction.
4) Request alternatives or counter-approaches for comparison.
5) Synthesize and adapt the output in my own words for my actual context.
        </pre>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>4. Cognitive Bandwidth vs. Outsourcing Judgment</summary>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> What does it mean to expand cognitive bandwidth without outsourcing judgment?
        Give a short example.</p>
        <p><strong>Suggested answer:</strong></p>
        <pre>
Expanding cognitive bandwidth means using AI to generate more ideas, perspectives, or examples than I could alone,
while I still decide what is accurate, ethical, and appropriate to use. For example, AI can draft many activity ideas
for a course, but I choose which ones to implement and how to adapt them to my students.
        </pre>
    </details>

    <h2>Reflection: How Will You Work with AI?</h2>
    <p>
        Use the prompts below for written reflection or group discussion. These can also be embedded into a Canvas
        assignment or journal activity.
    </p>

    <details>
        <summary>Personal Practice Reflection</summary>
        <pre>
- Where in your current work do you most often default to “input/output” interactions with AI?
- How could you redesign one of those interactions as an inquiry-based conversation?
- What boundaries do you want to set for yourself about when AI is not appropriate?
        </pre>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Teaching and Mentoring Reflection</summary>
        <pre>
- How will you explain iterative collaboration with AI to your students or colleagues?
- What guardrails do you want to put in place so that AI supports, rather than replaces, learning?
- What is one concrete activity or assignment you might redesign using the patterns from this module?
        </pre>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Equity and Responsibility Reflection</summary>
        <pre>
- How might AI tools amplify existing inequities if used uncritically in your context?
- How can iterative collaboration (with explicit human judgment) help mitigate some of those risks?
- What will you need from your department or institution to use AI responsibly?
        </pre>
    </details>

    <p>
        Thank you for engaging with Module 2. As you move into subsequent modules, carry forward a clear commitment:
        use AI to widen what you can see and consider, while keeping ownership of what you ultimately decide, create,
        and share.
