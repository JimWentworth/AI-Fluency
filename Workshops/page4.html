    <h2>AI as a Bandwidth Expander, Not a Replacement</h2>
    <p>
        Generative AI can dramatically increase how many ideas, perspectives, and examples you can surface in a short 
        time. The risk is that this abundance can tempt us to hand over judgment entirely. The goal of this module is 
        to use AI to <strong>expand cognitive bandwidth</strong> while keeping humans firmly responsible for what 
        ultimately leaves the lab, classroom, or inbox.
    </p>

    <div class="callout">
        <svg class="icon" width="22" height="22" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="#E84A27" aria-hidden="true">
            <path d="M4 4h7v7H4V4zm9 0h7v7h-7V4zM4 13h7v7H4v-7zm9 3h7v4h-7v-4z"/>
        </svg>
        <strong>Healthy posture:</strong> Let AI handle generative sprawl, while you own selection, prioritization, and accountability.
    </div>

    <h2>Where Expanded Bandwidth Helps</h2>

    <details>
        <summary>Exploring many examples quickly</summary>
        <p>
            You can ask AI for numerous examples, analogies, or use cases, then filter for what aligns with your 
            goals and values.
        </p>
        <pre>
Generate 15 different examples to illustrate this concept for:
[discipline or audience].

Group them into:
- highly relevant,
- somewhat relevant,
- edge cases.

Briefly explain your grouping.
        </pre>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Scanning for blind spots</summary>
        <p>
            AI can simulate perspectives you might not naturally adopt, offering a first-pass check for overlooked 
            stakeholders or unintended consequences.
        </p>
        <pre>
Given this plan:
[paste summary],

identify perspectives or stakeholders that might see this very differently.
For each, describe what concerns or objections they might raise.
        </pre>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Recombining ideas across domains</summary>
        <p>
            Because AI is trained on varied domains, it can propose cross-disciplinary analogies that you then 
            vet for accuracy and appropriateness.
        </p>
    </details>

    <h2>Guardrails to Avoid Outsourcing Judgment</h2>

    <details>
        <summary>Always articulate your own stance</summary>
        <p>
            After AI offers ideas, pause to state your own position in your own words before asking for another 
            round of input.
        </p>
        <pre>
Based on what you’ve suggested and my own expertise, here is my current view:
[write your own summary].

Now, help me refine this view by:
- highlighting possible overconfidence,
- pointing out what evidence would strengthen or weaken it.
        </pre>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Make evaluation criteria explicit</summary>
        <p>
            Before selecting or endorsing AI-generated content, clarify what “good” means for this context.
        </p>
        <pre>
For this task, high-quality output means:
[list criteria].

Evaluate the ideas you just generated against those criteria.
Which should I prioritize, and which should I discard, and why?
        </pre>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Resist the temptation to copy-paste</summary>
        <p>
            Paste AI-generated text into a separate space and actively edit it, adding your own examples, nuance, and 
            local detail. This is where real learning and ownership happen.
        </p>
    </details>

    <h2>Reflection Activity: Who Is Doing the Thinking?</h2>
    <p>
        Use the following questions after an AI-assisted task:
    </p>
    <pre>
- What key decisions did I personally make in this process?
- Where did I rely most heavily on AI, and why?
- If someone challenged this work, could I defend the reasoning as my own?
- What did I learn that I could now do without AI next time?
    </pre>
    <p>
        The goal is not to minimize AI use, but to ensure that your expertise and ethical commitments remain 
        visible, defensible, and central.
